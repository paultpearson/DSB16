## Abbreviations and terms

- LV = Left Ventricle

- Image segmentation: "The goal of image segmentation is to divide an image into a set of semantically meaningful, homogeneous, and nonoverlapping regions of similar attributes such as intensity, depth, color, or texture. The segmentation result is either an image of labels identifying each homogeneous region or a set of contours which describe the region boundaries." [MRI Segmentation of the Human Brain: Challenges, Methods, and Applications](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2015/450341/)

- ROI = circular Region Of Interest
